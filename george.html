    <h1>1984</h1>
    <p>Müəllif: George Orwell </p>
    <p>Qiymət: 7 AZN</p>
    <p>1984 is the year in which it happens. The world is divided into three great powers, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, each perpettually at the war with the other. Throughout
        Oceania “ The Party” rules by the agency of four ministries, whose power is absolute- The Ministry of Peace which deals with war, the Ministry of Love (Headquarters
        of the dreaded Thought police) which deals with law and order, the Ministry of Plenty, which deals in scarcities, and the Ministry of Truth which deals with
        propaganda. The authorities keep a check on every action, word, gesture, or thought. George Orwell’s satire has been compared with that
        of Swift, and in Ninteen Eighty-four the satire is the framework for one of the most moving stories to have been published in this generation- the human story of Winston
        Smith and his revolt against the Party’s Rules.   </p>
